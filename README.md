# Spotify Playlist Shuffler üéµ

This project is an application to manage a Spotify playlist, shuffle songs, de-duplicate tracks, and update playlist images using the Spotify Web API. It integrates OAuth2.0 for authentication and authorization while using Spotify's extensive API to manipulate playlists and liked songs.

## Features ‚ú®

- **OAuth2.0 Integration**:
    - Supports Spotify authorization flow.
    - Handles access token generation, refreshing, and storage.

- **Playlist Management**:
    - Fetches user's playlists and allows selection of specific playlists for shuffling.
    - Adds tracks from liked songs and selected playlists to a target shuffle playlist.
    - De-duplicates and shuffles the target shuffle playlist.

- **Image Customization**:
    - Updates the cover image of the shuffle playlist using a user-provided image.

- **Local Storage**:
    - Saves access and refresh tokens securely to disk.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

### Pre-requisites
1. **Spotify Developer Account**:
    - Create your Spotify app at the [Spotify Developer Console](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
    - Note down your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and setup a redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/callback`).

2. **Java Environment**:
    - Requires Java 21 or newer. Ensure the appropriate SDK is installed.

3. **Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory or use environment variable management tools like:

   ```dotenv
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT=your_spotify_client_id
   SPOTIFY_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
   SHUFFLE_PLAYLIST=your_target_shuffle_playlist_id
   ```

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. **Authorization Flow**
- The application initiates Spotify's OAuth2.0 authentication.
- Run the application and open the provided URL in your web browser to authorize.
- A local HTTP server captures the callback and retrieves access tokens.

### 2. **Playlist Manipulation**
- Pulls user playlists and tracks from liked songs.
- Allows users to select playlists for shuffling.
- De-duplicates tracks and ensures unique song additions to the `SHUFFLE_PLAYLIST`.

### 3. **Shuffling & Updating**
- The application shuffles the tracks 20 times for randomness.
- Updates the existing shuffle playlist with new tracks.
- Refreshes the playlist cover image using user-provided artwork.
